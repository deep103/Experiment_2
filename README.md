Experiment 2 of WDL
For Designing and Creating a Resume using HTML & CSS, I have created 3 pages of detailed resume with each page clearly focusing on its main aspect of describing itself.

You can operate these files by using xampp server or you can manual access them by keeping them in specific folder and open it from there

The order of pages are as follows:
CV PG1> CV PG2> CV PG3
